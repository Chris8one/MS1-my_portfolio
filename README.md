## Testing

HTML code passed on W3C's HTML validator.
CSS code passed on W3C's CSS validator.

The website has been tested on following units:

- Apple MacBook Pro 2018 13 inch with MacOS Catalina with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
- Different computers with Windows 10, Google Chrome and Firefox.
- Samsung Galaxy A41s, Google Chrome and Samsungs internet browser.
- Samsung Galaxy A20, Google Chrome and Samsungs internet browser.

The scrolling for links on mobile view needs some more work done to it.
It doesn't scrolls and stops where I want it to.
